abstract = {Abstract A very simple energy-balance equation for the mean surface temperature of the planet (Budyko-type model) is perturbed by a stochastic term, simulating the numerous ‘weather’ processes not considered in the deterministic feed-back term. In the first instance, a symmetrical deterministic process with three equilibrium states is considered. Using standard methods for determination of the probability density distribution, the characteristic time which the climate system spends in the neighbourhood of one stable equilibrium before shifting to the other is expressed in terms of the characteristic time of the feed-back process and the time constant of the perturbing process. Realistic corresponding values are found. an Appendix discusses the possibility of using the analogy between stochastically perturbed Newtonian and quantum-dynamical systems in research on climate change.},

  abstract = 	 { We perform scalable approximate inference in continuous-depth Bayesian neural networks. In this model class, uncertainty about separate weights in each layer gives hidden units that follow a stochastic differential equation. We demonstrate gradient-based stochastic variational inference in this infinite-parameter setting, producing arbitrarily-flexible approximate posteriors. We also derive a novel gradient estimator that approaches zero variance as the approximate posterior over weights approaches the true posterior. This approach brings continuous-depth Bayesian neural nets to a competitive comparison against discrete-depth alternatives, while inheriting the memory-efficient training and tunable precision of Neural ODEs. }
